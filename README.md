Interactive Graphics on the Web

For this project, I will be making digital versions of three games that one would normally see played with pen and paper. These games are Mad Libs, Hangman, and Dots. The layout will mimic a normal pen and paper look, with color added for aesthetic purposes. The Mad Libs game will first show the traditional word type with blank lines, where the user will type in what word they want to use. For instance, the first line might say: noun: _____. The user would then type in a noun that they want to put in the story. Hangman will have a list of the letters, and the user will click on the letter they wish to pick. It will then be crossed out, and then it will be inserted into the correct blanks of the word or phrase, or a body part will be drawn if the letter is not in the phrase. Dots will be the traditional dot drawing game, with the user clicking and dragging between two adjacent dots to draw a line. The game will be made for two players, so the line being drawn will alternate between two colors. When a box is filled, it will fill with the last color that was used.
I plan on using this project to replace the grades for projects 1 and 2. I am most likely going to need to draw graphics onto a page, especially for the hangman page. This will most likely be done with the canvas API. SVG should be the simplest way to create the dots game. I should be able to complete the Mad Libs game using just the jQuery libraries.
