        <h2>Navigation</h2>
        <p>
            I wanted the navigation page to be as simple as possible. It needed to look like a child could have drawn it.
            Originally, I wanted the three links staggered in a triangle, with one link in front and the other links below to the 
            left and right. When I asked for advice from a friend in the New Media Design program, she advised me that it might look better if each of the three main 
            pages were put in a row using flexbox. Seeing as she had more design experience than me, I took her advice. I wanted the boxes 
            themselves to be the links to the other pages, however that seemed to mess with the width and margin of each box, so I eventually
            gave up and decided to use the words inside each box as the link.

        <h2>Mad Libs</h2>
        <p>
            Mad Libs was the first page I worked on after the main page. I found a working prototype from
            <a href="https://codepen.io/Pyremell/pen/ONgexd">codepen.io</a> which worked well.
            Originally, it would pop up a window for each word the user had to enter. I made  my own story
            to replace the premade one. At first I wanted to have it so it was just like a mad libs you would by in a store.
            So I wanted the story not to be shown until the user finished entering the words. I also wanted to have what type of word 
            should be entered with a blank line where the word should be. I tried to figure out how to do that, and after an hour I decided 
            that the best thing to do was to do a simple html form instead.
            After a couple of hours of trying to use functions so that the story would only be shown after all words were entered,
            I decided that the easiest thing to do was to just make a button that generated the story. Once I had that working,
            the biggest problem for this page was created. No matter what I entered in each text box, the words would not end up in the story.
            I tried to figure this out for several hours, going back and forth between my code, W3Schools, and Stack Overflow, It finally worked
            after I decided to create the variables for each word inside the method done once the button was clicked.
