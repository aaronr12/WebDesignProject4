        <h2>Navigation</h2>
        <p>
            I wanted the navigation page to be as simple as possible. It needed to look like a child could have drawn it.
            Originally, I wanted the three links staggered in a triangle, with one link in front and the other links below to the 
            left and right. When I asked for advice from a friend in the New Media Design program, she advised me that it might look better if each of the three main 
            pages were put in a row using flexbox. Seeing as she had more design experience than me, I took her advice. I wanted the boxes 
            themselves to be the links to the other pages, however that seemed to mess with the width and margin of each box, so I eventually
            gave up and decided to use the words inside each box as the link.

        <h2>Mad Libs</h2>
        <p>
            Mad Libs was the first page I worked on after the main page. I found a working prototype from
            <a href="https://codepen.io/Pyremell/pen/ONgexd">codepen.io</a> which worked well.
            Originally, it would pop up a window for each word the user had to enter. I made  my own story
            to replace the premade one. At first I wanted to have it so it was just like a mad libs you would by in a store.
            So I wanted the story not to be shown until the user finished entering the words. I also wanted to have what type of word 
            should be entered with a blank line where the word should be. I tried to figure out how to do that, and after an hour I decided 
            that the best thing to do was to do a simple html form instead.
            After a couple of hours of trying to use functions so that the story would only be shown after all words were entered,
            I decided that the easiest thing to do was to just make a button that generated the story. Once I had that working,
            the biggest problem for this page was created. No matter what I entered in each text box, the words would not end up in the story.
            I tried to figure this out for several hours, going back and forth between my code, W3Schools, and Stack Overflow, It finally worked
            after I decided to create the variables for each word inside the method done once the button was clicked.

        <h2>Hangman</h2>
        <p>
            <a href="https://codepen.io/cathydutton/pen/ldazc">See the Template I used</a>
        </p>

        <p>
            I ended up keeping most of what the template had. I reorganized the game so that the drawings and 
            lives counter were above the letters. I also changed the words, categories, and hints. I changed the color scheme to be 
            similar to the rest of the website, with a bit of school spirit. 
        </p>

        <h2>Dots and Boxes</h2>
        <p>
            There was very little I could do to about the dots and boxes game. The first template I found was incredibly difficult to understand and the actual 
            page looked very rough around the edges. The second template I found was much simpler and looked nicer on screen. However, It was still very complicated 
            and several javascript files to work properly. I found that I could change very little and have the game still work as intended. I spent some time trying to 
            allow you to select the number of players in game, but the game would not change from the default number. Also, I tried to have the page prompt each player for 
            their name, but when the prompts were finished the game still wouldn't load. All in all, the dots and boxes game was the most difficult to grasp and would most 
            likely have benefitted from choosing a different game for the third web page.
